# Ex.No: 13 Learning – Use Supervised Learning  
### DATE:                                                                            
### REGISTER NUMBER : 212222060311
### AIM: 
To write a program to train a classifier for phishing website detection using supervised learning.
###  Algorithm:
1.Import Libraries: Load required libraries like pandas, sklearn, and gradio.

2.Load Dataset: Load the phishing dataset from a CSV file containing features like HTTPS, IP address, suspicious words, etc.

3.Preprocess Data: Separate the features and labels (X, y) from the dataset.

4.Model Selection: Choose RandomForestClassifier as the supervised learning model.

5.Train the Model: Fit the model on the training data (X, y).

6.Feature Extraction Function: Create a function to extract features from user input (URL, HTTPS, etc.).

7.Prediction Function: Predict if a given URL is phishing or legitimate based on user inputs.

8.Create Frontend with Gradio: Build an interactive web UI using gradio.Blocks for user-friendly input and output.
### Program:
```
import gradio as gr
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier

# Load dataset from CSV
df = pd.read_csv("phishing_data.csv")
X = df.drop("Label", axis=1)
y = df["Label"]

# Train the model
model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
model.fit(X, y)

# Feature extraction from user input
def extract_features(url, https, ip_address, has_at, suspicious_words, short_url):
    return [
        1 if https.lower() == "yes" else 0,
        1 if ip_address.lower() == "yes" else 0,
        1 if has_at.lower() == "yes" else 0,
        len(url),
        url.count('.'),
        1 if suspicious_words.lower() == "yes" else 0,
        1 if short_url.lower() == "yes" else 0
    ]

# Prediction logic
def predict_url(url, https, ip, at, suspicious, shortener):
    features = extract_features(url, https, ip, at, suspicious, shortener)
    prediction = model.predict([features])[0]
    return "🟥 Phishing (Not Legitimate)" if prediction == 1 else "🟩 Legitimate Website"

# Gradio UI
with gr.Blocks(css=".gradio-container {font-family: 'Segoe UI', sans-serif;}") as demo:
    gr.Markdown("# 🛡️ PhishGuard: Advanced Phishing URL Detection")

    with gr.Accordion("🔗 Step 1: Enter the Website URL", open=True):
        url = gr.Textbox(label="Enter the full website URL")

    with gr.Accordion("🔐 Step 2: Does it start with HTTPS?"):
        https = gr.Radio(["Yes", "No"], label="Starts with HTTPS?")

    with gr.Accordion("📟 Step 3: Does it contain an IP address?"):
        ip = gr.Radio(["Yes", "No"], label="Contains IP Address?")

    with gr.Accordion("📧 Step 4: Does it contain an '@' symbol?"):
        at = gr.Radio(["Yes", "No"], label="Contains '@' Symbol?")

    with gr.Accordion("🔍 Step 5: Are suspicious words present?"):
        suspicious = gr.Radio(["Yes", "No"], label="Words like 'login', 'bank', 'verify'?")

    with gr.Accordion("🧩 Step 6: Is it a shortened URL?"):
        shortener = gr.Radio(["Yes", "No"], label="Shortened URL?")

    with gr.Row():
        submit = gr.Button("🔎 Check Website Safety")
        output = gr.Textbox(label="Prediction", lines=2)

    submit.click(fn=predict_url,
                 inputs=[url, https, ip, at, suspicious, shortener],
                 outputs=output)

demo.launch()
```

### Output:

### Result:
Thus, the phishing website classifier was successfully trained using supervised learning and was able to make predictions based on user inputs.
